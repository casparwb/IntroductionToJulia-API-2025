    "Julia matches the performance of C/Fortran not because of better hardware or better compilers than e.g., Python uses, but because of design. Julia is interactive like Python, but it is not an interpreted language, it is a **compiled** one. This means that **every function call in Julia first gets compiled, based on the exact input types**. Then it is executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "*(this compilation only happens once for each unique combination of input types)*\n",
    "\n",
    "When the compiler compiles a function, these types of every variable can be tracked throughout the function and all datastructures are mapped uniquely and deterministically all the way from input to output. This allows the compiler to make all the optimizations that e.g. the compilation of a C language code would do. And this (in a nutshell) is what results in the same performance as C/Fortran.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tracking of types mentioned above only works if **the type of every variable remains the same type throughout the function's operations**. Notice the distinction: the _type_ (i.e. all floating point variables remain floats) is constant, but of course the _value_ could change (i.e. going from `515134.515` to `123415.242` is fine).\n",
