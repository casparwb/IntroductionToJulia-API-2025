However, it is [recommended](https://dataframes.juliadata.org/stable/man/querying_frameworks/#Data-manipulation-frameworks) to use a package dedicated to querying and data manupulation that provides simpler/easier syntax for it. Several options exist, each providing a slightly different variant on the syntax, so you can pick whatever you feel most comfortable in. Here we will use a LINQ-like [Query.jl](https://www.queryverse.org/Query.jl/stable/) syntax, which can be used with any tabular Julia data."
